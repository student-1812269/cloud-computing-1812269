# Instructions for running the project

Simplest way - download the 1812269.apk and run it on an Android device. 

Otherwise:

Install Node.js - https://nodejs.org/en/
Install Expo CLI - https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/
Run 'npm install' inside the project's root folder to install the required packages

There are multiple options for running Expo depending on whether you are using an emulator or a physical device. Instructions here - https://docs.expo.io/guides/testing-on-devices/

Once you have set up the emulator/connected a physical device, run 'amplify serve' from the root project folder and scan the QR code shown to connect.
